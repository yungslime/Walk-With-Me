This repository contains the software i wrote to create Walk With Me.

The software consists of two main parts - the logger which is a node.js script running on a raspberry pi, and the converter which is a python script to convert the logs to midi files containing CC data.

My hardware setup for the logging box looked like this. (Click to enlarge)

If you want to try building your own, feel free to copy my scripts and make any modifications necessary to make it work with your setup.
